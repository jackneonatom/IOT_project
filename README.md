# Smart Environmental Control System

## Overview

The Smart Environmental Control System is an IoT project designed to monitor and control environmental conditions in a room, such as temperature and light levels, and automate devices like fans and lights based on user preferences and environmental data.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously monitors temperature and presence in the room using sensors.
- **Automatic Control**: Automatically adjusts fan and light settings based on user-defined preferences and environmental conditions.
- **Remote Access**: Allows users to remotely control and monitor the system via a web interface.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides graphical representation of environmental data collected over time for analysis.

## Hardware Components

- **ESP32 Microcontroller**: Used to interface with sensors, control devices, and communicate with the backend API.
- **Temperature Sensor (DS18B20)**: Measures room temperature.
- **Presence Sensor**: Detects presence of individuals in the room.
- **Relay Modules**: Control the operation of fan and light devices.

## Software Components

- **Backend API**: Developed using FastAPI (Python) to handle HTTP requests, manage user settings, and interact with the database.
- **Database (MongoDB)**: Stores user settings, sensor data, and system logs.
- **Frontend Web Interface**: Allows users to view system status, configure settings, and visualize data trends.
- **Arduino Sketch**: Runs on the ESP32 microcontroller to collect sensor data and control devices based on API responses.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/smart-environmental-control.git`
2. Set up the backend API by installing dependencies and configuring environment variables.
3. Flash the Arduino sketch to the ESP32 microcontroller and wire up the sensors and relay modules.
4. Access the web interface to configure settings and monitor the system.

## Usage

1. Configure user settings such as preferred temperature, light schedule, and fan control mode via the web interface.
2. Place sensors in the desired location and ensure proper functioning.
3. The system will automatically adjust fan and light settings based on environmental conditions and user preferences.
